# math-as-rust

>Based on [math-as-code](https://github.com/Jam3/math-as-code/blob/master/rust-README.md)

This is a reference to ease developers into mathematical notation by showing comparisons with Rust code.

Motivation: Academic papers can be intimidating for self-taught graphics programmers and data wranglers :)

## foreword

Mathematical symbols can mean different things depending on the author, context and the field of study (linear algebra, set theory, etc). This guide may not cover *all* uses of a symbol. In some cases, real-world references (blog posts, publications, etc) will be cited to demonstrate how a symbol might appear in the wild.

For a more complete list, refer to [Wikipedia - List of Mathematical Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols).

For simplicity, many of the code examples here operate on floating point values and are not numerically robust. For more details on why this may be a problem, see [Robust Arithmetic Notes](https://github.com/mikolalysenko/robust-arithmetic-notes) by Mikola Lysenko.

## variable name conventions

There are a variety of naming conventions depending on the context and field of study, and they are not always consistent. However, in some of the literature you may find variable names to follow a pattern like so:

- *s* - italic lowercase letters for scalars (e.g. a number)
- **x** - bold lowercase letters for vectors (e.g. a 2D point)
- **A** - bold uppercase letters for matrices (e.g. a 3D transformation)
- *θ* - italic lowercase Greek letters for constants and special variables (e.g. [polar angle *θ*, *theta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system))

This will also be the format of this guide.

## equals symbols

There are a number of symbols resembling the equals sign `=`. Here are a few common examples:

- `=` is for equality (values are the same)
- `≠` is for inequality (value are not the same)
- `≈` is for approximately equal to (`π ≈ 3.14159`)
- `:=` is for definition (A is defined as B)

In Rust:

```rust
// equality
2 == 3

// inequality
2 != 3

// approximately equal
#[macro_use]
extern crate is_close;

// is_close! doesn't have a third argument for tolerance, so this is false
is_close!(std::f64::consts::PI, 3.14159), true)

fn is_almost_equal(x: f64, y: f64, epsilon: f64) -> bool {
    (x - y).abs() < (10f64.powf(-epsilon))
}

is_almost_equal(std::f64::consts::PI, 3.14159, 1e-5) // true
```

> **Read more**: programmers got this idea from the [epsilon-delta definition of limit][1]

In mathematical notation, you might see the `:=`, `=:` and `=` symbols being used for *definition*.<sup>[2]</sup>

For example, the following defines *x* to be another name for 2*kj*.

![equals1](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%20%3A%3D%202kj)

<!-- x := 2kj -->

In rust, we *define* our variables with `=`.

```rust
let x = 2 * k * j
```

*Assignment* in rust variables are immutable by default.

> **Note**: Some languages have pre-processor `#define` statements, which are closer to a mathematical *define*.

Notice that `fn` is a form of `:=` as well.

```rust
fn plus(x: f64, y: f64) -> f64 {
  x + y
}
```

The following, on the other hand, represents equality:

![equals2](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%20%3D%202kj)

<!-- x = 2kj -->

**Important**: the difference between `=` and `==` can be more obvious in code than it is in math literature! In rust, a `=` is an *instruction*. You're telling the machine to interact with the namespace, add something to it or change something in it. In rust, when you write `==` you're asking the machine "may I have a `bool`?". In math, the former case is *either* covered by `:=` or `=`, while the latter case is *usually* `=`, and you might have to do some disambiguating in your reading.

In math, when I write 1 + 1 = 2 I'm making a *judgment*. It's not that i'm asking the world (or the chalkboard) for a bool, it's that I'm keeping track of my beliefs. This distinction is the foundation of *unit tests* or *assertions*.
